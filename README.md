# 📌 TaskMind - Visual Task Management with Interactive Diagrams

**TaskMind** is not just another to-do app; it's a visual approach to task management! Each task is represented as a shape, allowing you to interact directly with tasks by clicking on shapes to update their status. As someone who loves to see projects in a visual structure, I built this app for personal use, and I’m sharing it for others who might find it useful. Give it a try!
